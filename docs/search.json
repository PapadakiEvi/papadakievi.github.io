    "text": "Beyond the Mathematics of the Moment\n\n\n\n\n\nOpportunities for discussion beyond the mathematics of the moment in a drawing (fictional situation).  Credits: Evi Papadaki\n\n\n\n\n\nMy doctoral research focused on exploring the opportunities for discussion beyond the mathematics of the moment (BeMoM, i.e., ideas and practices that are not part of the mathematics curriculum) among secondary school mathematics teachers and their students. Aiming to capture the classroom discourse, I collected data from classroom observations and interviews with teachers and teacher educators. I also proposed and piloted, with a focus group of teachers, design principles for vignette-based professional development activities to support teachers in having BeMoM discussions with their students. My findings highlight the unique communicational patterns that emerge in BeMoM situations, through the lens of the Theory of Commognition. My work contributes to sociocultural theories in Mathematics Education and provides insights into teachers’ discourses beyond the mathematics curriculum with an outlook into students’ futures as citizens and professionals."

    "text": "Research & Teaching Activities\nMy teaching and research activities are intertwined – they feed into each other, growing and evolving together.\nMy research focuses on mathematical discourses, with a particular interest in how communication unfolds in mathematics classrooms. Teaching has sharpened my awareness of discursive practices and how teachers and learners discuss ideas that go beyond the mathematics of the moment (i.e., beyond the curriculum). I am also interested in how mathematics discourses transform into disciplinary discourses during the transition to university.\nA key im of my work is to challenge risk-averse teaching practices and stereotypes in Mathematics Education. During my postgraduate studies, I made a deliberate choice to work in mathematics student support, ensuring that I remained grounded in practice. I also gained valuable experiences teaching research methods in education and mathematics education modules.\nIn my current roles, I draw on my expertise in Mathematics Education research to support teaching across both higher and secondary education. At the University of Bath, I collaborate with colleagues across disciplines to enhance mathematical and statistical learning, design context-rich teaching materials, and advise undergraduate, Master’s, and PhD students on quantitative research methodologies. Alongside this, I teach A-level Further Mathematics two days a week at a local school, keeping me closely connected to the realities of the classroom and the challenges faced by students and teachers in pre-university education.\nSince November 2023, I serve as the events secretary for the sigma Network for Excellence in Mathematics and Statistics Support in Higher Education – a national community that promotes inclusive, evidence-informed practice and fosters collaboration among those supporting mathematical learning across the sector.\nThe teaching collaborations opened avenues for engaging in practice-based research projects exploring and evaluating novel approaches of facilitating learning. I am also in collaborations with colleagues from the University of Southampton and the University of Seville, Spain in a research project focused on exploring the mathematical and pedagogical discourses of pre-service teachers. Finally, I am a Research Associate for the MathTASK project."
