Credits: Evi Papadaki\n\n\n\n\n\nMy doctoral research focused on exploring the opportunities for discussion beyond the mathematics of the moment (BeMoM, i.e., ideas and practices that are not part of the mathematics curriculum) among secondary school mathematics teachers and their students. Aiming to capture the classroom discourse, I collected data from classroom observations and interviews with teachers and teacher educators. I also proposed and piloted, with a focus group of teachers, design principles for vignette-based professional development activities to support teachers in having BeMoM discussions with their students. My findings highlight the unique communicational patterns that emerge in BeMoM situations, through the lens of the Theory of Commognition. My work contributes to sociocultural theories in Mathematics Education and provides insights into teachers’ discourses beyond the mathematics curriculum with an outlook into students’ futures as citizens and professionals."

I am Evi (she/her) and I love mathematics and teaching.\nI am an early career researcher in Mathematics Education with an interest in mathematics teaching and student support. Outside of work, I find joy in knitting, sewing, and painting – each with varying levels of success but always with a zest for creating something unique and developing new skills along the way.\nHave a wander through my website to learn more."

    "text": "Research & Teaching Activities\nMy teaching and research activities are intertwined – they feed into each other, growing and evolving together.\nMy research focuses on exploring mathematical discourses. My teaching experience sharpened my sensitivity to classroom discursive activities and the role language plays in the learning of mathematics. I am particularly interested in patterns of communication during discussions about ideas and practices that go beyond the mathematics of the moment (i.e., beyond the curriculum). I am also interested in how mathematics discourses are transformed into disciplinary discourses during the transition to university.\nMy move into academia emerged with a view to challenge risk avert teaching practices and stereotypes in Mathematics Education. I made a deliberate choice to work in mathematics student support alongside my postgraduate studies, ensuring that I remained grounded in practice. I also gained valuable experiences teaching research methods in education and mathematics education modules.\nIn my current teaching role, I utilise my expertise in Mathematics Education research in interdisciplinary collaborations to support the teaching of mathematics and statistics across the University of Bath. I also design teaching and learning materials, covering a variety of mathematics topics contextualised with discipline specific examples and I advise BA, Master, and PhD students on quantitative methodologies.\nIn November, I took up the role of the events secretary for the sigma Network for excellence in mathematics and statistics support in Higher Education.\nThe teaching collaborations opened avenues for engaging in practice-based research projects exploring and evaluating novel approaches of facilitating learning. I am also in collaborations with colleagues from the University of Southampton and the University of Seville, Spain in a research project focused on exploring the mathematical and pedagogical discourses of pre-service teachers. Finally, I am a Research Associate for the MathTASK project."
