Credits: Evi Papadaki\n\n\n\n\n\nMy doctoral research focused on exploring the opportunities for discussion beyond the mathematics of the moment (BeMoM, i.e., ideas and practices that are not part of the mathematics curriculum) among secondary school mathematics teachers and their students. Aiming to capture the classroom discourse, I collected data from classroom observations and interviews with teachers and teacher educators. I also proposed and piloted, with a focus group of teachers, design principles for vignette-based professional development activities to support teachers in having BeMoM discussions with their students. My findings highlight the unique communicational patterns that emerge in BeMoM situations, through the lens of the Theory of Commognition. My work contributes to sociocultural theories in Mathematics Education and provides insights into teachers’ discourses beyond the mathematics curriculum with an outlook into students’ futures as citizens and professionals."

    "text": "I still remember a seminar during my final year as an undergraduate mathematics student. We were exploring different representations used to teach fractions in school, when our lecturer posed a simple but puzzling question: “How do fractions, as taught in school, link with mathematical ideas you’ve learnt during your undergraduate studies?”\nThe room went quiet for what felt like ages. Then someone mentioned equivalence classes—and something changed for me. It was my very own ‘aha’ moment. Looking back, I began to recognise more connections between the mathematical topics I had encountered over the years. I realised that some of my teachers had been gently pointing at those connections, even if I couldn’t grasp them at the time. Their words stayed with me, waiting for the right moment to develop new meanings.\nThat moment shaped my identity as a mathematics teacher and researcher. Since then, I’ve come to appreciate that mathematics taught in school can connect to so much more than what the curriculum prescribes—if we’re willing to deviate from simply enacting guidelines and make space for explorative discussions.\nBeyond the mathematics of the moment, is a space where I bring together my teaching practice and my research interests in meaningful, practical ways. The name is inspired a description in Ball & Bass (2009):\n\n[…] those aspects of the mathematics that, while perhaps not contained in the curriculum, are nonetheless useful to pupils’ present learning, that illuminate and confer a comprehensible sense of the larger significance of what may be only partially revealed in the mathematics of the moment [my emphasis] (para. 17).\n\nI’ll be sharing:\n\nShare classroom activities and teaching practices that have sparked curiosity beyond standard curricula.\nDiscuss resources that have been instrumental in bridging theoretical concepts with practical applications.\nReflect on conversations and experiences with students and colleagues that have enriched my understanding of mathematics education.\n\nThe blog documents my efforts to bring together teaching practice and my research interests in meaningful, practical ways.\nWhether you’re a teacher, a researcher, or simply someone who enjoys thinking deeply about mathematics and learning, I hope you’ll find something here that resonates. Let’s go beyond the mathematics of the moment—together.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBall, D., & Bass, H. (2009).

    "text": "Research & Teaching Activities\nMy teaching and research activities are intertwined – they feed into each other, growing and evolving together.\nMy research focuses on exploring mathematical discourses. My teaching experience sharpened my sensitivity to classroom discursive activities and the role language plays in the learning of mathematics. I am particularly interested in patterns of communication during discussions about ideas and practices that go beyond the mathematics of the moment (i.e., beyond the curriculum). I am also interested in how mathematics discourses are transformed into disciplinary discourses during the transition to university.\nMy move into academia emerged with a view to challenge risk avert teaching practices and stereotypes in Mathematics Education. I made a deliberate choice to work in mathematics student support alongside my postgraduate studies, ensuring that I remained grounded in practice. I also gained valuable experiences teaching research methods in education and mathematics education modules.\nIn my current teaching role, I utilise my expertise in Mathematics Education research in interdisciplinary collaborations to support the teaching of mathematics and statistics across the University of Bath. I also design teaching and learning materials, covering a variety of mathematics topics contextualised with discipline specific examples and I advise BA, Master, and PhD students on quantitative methodologies.\nIn November, I took up the role of the events secretary for the sigma Network for excellence in mathematics and statistics support in Higher Education.\nThe teaching collaborations opened avenues for engaging in practice-based research projects exploring and evaluating novel approaches of facilitating learning. I am also in collaborations with colleagues from the University of Southampton and the University of Seville, Spain in a research project focused on exploring the mathematical and pedagogical discourses of pre-service teachers. Finally, I am a Research Associate for the MathTASK project."

    "text": "Do you have a task you absolutely love? One that you can’t wait to try again with a new class?\nFor me, that task is The Magic Carpet Ride (Wawro et al., 2012). Originally designed as an explorative introduction to Linear Algebra for college students in the US, it’s one of the most memorable tasks I encountered as a young researcher. You can download a free pre-print of Wawro et al. (2012)’s article here.\nTechnically, the task is aimed at students enrolled in a university-level Linear Algebra course. My 16-year-olds aren’t expected to learn about vector spaces, linear combinations, or linear span for another couple of years. But the blend of storytelling and mathematical depth makes me feel this is always a perfect opportunity to venture beyond the mathematics of the moment.\nSo here it is — my all-time favourite task.\nI was pleased to see that my students really liked it - even the more skeptical among them. So, once we’d explored the two-dimensional version thoroughly, I couldn’t resist going a step further.\nWe moved into three dimensions.\nI gave them two new vectors, \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 1 , 3 , 2 \\end{pmatrix}\\) and \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 1 , 2 , 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\), and asked whether they would be able to find Old Man Gauss hidden cabin.\nThen, I’ve introduced a new mean of transport, \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 0 , 0 , 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\), which I called the elevator for obvious reasons.\nWith just a few minutes left in the lesson, I decided to go all the way. “What if,” I asked, “your third vehicle isn’t an elevator but a magic bus that travels like this: \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 2 , 5 , 2 \\end{pmatrix}\\)?”\nThey realised very quickly that the magic bus the sum of the hover board and the magic carpet. So perhaps next time, I will have to use a more elaborate linear combination.\nI really enjoyed doing this task with my student. It gave us the opportunity to discuss important ideas in Linear Algebra that are not taught as part of the A-Level content. I also liked that I got the opportunity to tell them that this the key idea behind graphics in computer games (I saw some of my students eyes shine for the very first time at that moment).\nThis task brought us into rich conversations that aren’t part of the A-Level syllabus — yet are fundamental to understanding Linear Algebra later on. Best of all, it gave me the chance to connect maths to something they like: video games. When I mentioned that this kind of mathematics is the key idea behind graphics in video games, I saw a few pairs of eyes light up."
