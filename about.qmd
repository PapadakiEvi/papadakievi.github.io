::: {#about}
Hello and welcome to my little nook on the internet! I am Evi (she/her) and I love mathematics and teaching.

I am an early career researcher in Mathematics Education with an interest in mathematics teaching and student support. Outside of work, I find joy in knitting, sewing, and painting – each with varying levels of success but always with a zest for creating something unique and developing new skills along the way.

Have a wander through my website to learn more.

My teaching and research activities are intertwined – they feed into each other, growing and evolving together.

My research focuses on exploring mathematical discourses. My teaching experience sharpened my sensitivity to classroom discursive activities and the role language plays in the learning of mathematics. I am particularly interested in patterns of communication during discussions about ideas and practices that go *beyond the mathematics of the moment* (i.e., beyond the curriculum). I am also interested in how mathematics discourses are transformed into disciplinary discourses during the transition to university.

My move into academia emerged with a view to challenge risk avert teaching practices and stereotypes in Mathematics Education. I made a deliberate choice to work in mathematics student support alongside my postgraduate studies, ensuring that I remained grounded in practice. I also gained valuable experiences teaching research methods in education and mathematics education modules.

In my current teaching role, I utilise my expertise in Mathematics Education research in interdisciplinary collaborations to support the teaching of mathematics and statistics across the University of Bath. I also design teaching and learning materials, covering a variety of mathematics topics contextualised with discipline specific examples and I advise BA, Master, and PhD students on quantitative methodologies.

In November, I took up the role of the events secretary for the [sigma Network](https://www.sigma-network.ac.uk/) for excellence in mathematics and statistics support in Higher Education.

The teaching collaborations opened avenues for engaging in practice-based research projects exploring and evaluating novel approaches of facilitating learning. I am also in collaborations with colleagues from the University of Southampton and the University of Seville, Spain in a research project focused on exploring the mathematical and pedagogical discourses of pre-service teachers. Finally, I am a Research Associate for the [MathTASK](https://www.uea.ac.uk/groups-and-centres/a-z/mathtask) project.
