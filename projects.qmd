## Integrating worlds: teaching mathematics for other disciplines. 

::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
In my current role at the University of Bath, I collaborate with academics from various departments to enhance the teaching of mathematics and statistics across the university. These collaborations involve exchanging ideas and learning from each other's expertise to co-design curricula and resources tailored for non-mathematics specialists. This interdisciplinary approach has not only improved resource development but has also fostered opportunities for engaging in practice-based research.

A first step to this direction was a poster at the International Network for Didactic Research in University Mathematics (INDRUM2024) conference. The poster showcased the design of dynamic e-resources created with [NUMBAS©](https://numbas.mathcentre.ac.uk/), a collaborative effort between colleagues from the Mathematics Resources Centre, the Department of Life Sciences and the Department of Mathematical Sciences.

There is much more to come as we continue to explore innovative ways to integrate mathematics into various disciplines. Stay tuned!

My doctoral research focused on exploring the opportunities for discussion beyond the mathematics of the moment (BeMoM, i.e., ideas and practices that are not part of the mathematics curriculum) among secondary school mathematics teachers and their students. Aiming to capture the classroom discourse, I collected data from classroom observations and interviews with teachers and teacher educators. I also proposed and piloted, with a focus group of teachers, design principles for vignette-based professional development activities to support teachers in having BeMoM discussions with their students. My findings highlight the unique communicational patterns that emerge in BeMoM situations, through the lens of the Theory of Commognition. My work contributes to sociocultural theories in Mathematics Education and provides insights into teachers' discourses beyond the mathematics curriculum with an outlook into students’ futures as citizens and professionals.
