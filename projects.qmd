My doctoral research focused on exploring the opportunities for discussion beyond the mathematics of the moment (BeMoM, i.e., ideas and practices that are not part of the mathematics curriculum) among secondary school mathematics teachers and their students. Aiming to capture the classroom discourse, I collected data from classroom observations and interviews with teachers and teacher educators. I also proposed and piloted, with a focus group of teachers, design principles for vignette-based professional development activities to support teachers in having BeMoM discussions with their students. My findings highlight the unique communicational patterns that emerge in BeMoM situations, through the lens of the Theory of Commognition. My work contributes to sociocultural theories in Mathematics Education and provides insights into teachers' discourses beyond the mathematics curriculum with an outlook into studentsâ€™ futures as citizens and professionals.
