<!--This blog documents my efforts to bring my teaching practices and research interests together in meaningful and practical ways. I share activities I've tried, resources I've found useful, and reflect on discussions I've had with my students. Through these, I hope to inspire more teachers to go *beyond the mathematics of the moment*, while I explore how theory can inform my practice, and how my teaching practices can, in turn, enrich my research.-->
